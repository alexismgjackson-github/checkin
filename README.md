## WHY I BUILT THIS

I wanted to build an app that allowed me to journal my mental health. Also, I wanted more practice with Firebase!

## WHAT I LEARNED

### _USESTATE_

- Managing form's success/error messages
- Managing/toggling password visibility
- Managing check-ins
- Managing selected emotion for submission
- Managing modal open/close

### _USEEFFECT_

- Handling Firebase authentication state changes and ensuring check-ins are fetched when the user logs in
- Handles UI behavior (disabling/enabling scrolling) based on the modal state

### _RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN_

- Implementing media queries to add device breakpoints
- Using device breakpoints to change orientation, font size, etc
- Using CSS Grid and Flexbox

### _ACCESSIBILITY_

- Calculating the contrast ratio of text, icons and background colors using Coolors' Color Contrast Checker
- Adding aria-labels and alt tags to buttons, icons, etc

## MOST CHALLENGING

- Real-time data fetching and synching with Firestore

## BUGS

- I have not found any bugs yet

## FUTURE UPDATES

- Add pagination to modal
- Add filter to modal
